 Today we can see numerous news of buildings falling, constructional
errors(like public centric important places just fall on public)
ofcourse they were made for public uses but i am pretty sure these
all accidents arent a part of uses and no one ever will like to use
that resourses in that way.
I mean airports are made for flight landing not for airport landing
or switching people to permanent aeroplane mode this was *just a* example
taken from a lot of constructional failures.

Sol: 
    We can build a device using ultrasonic sonar sensors and tech which
checks cavities cracks and strength of construction i.e. walls and
roads etc
This device can be used for personal use of constructional checks too
before buying any property
